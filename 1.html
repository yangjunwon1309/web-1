<h1><strong>THE GUN</strong></h1>
<p> A gun is a tubular ranged weapon typically designed to pneumatically discharge projectiles<br>
   that are solid (most guns) but can also be liquid (as in water guns/cannons and projected w<br>
   ater disruptors) or even charged particles (as in a plasma gun) and may be free-flying (as <br>
   with bullets and artillery shells) or tethered (as with Taser guns, spearguns and harpoon <br>
   guns). The means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs, but are traditionally<br>
   effected by a high gas pressure contained within a shooting tube (gun barrel), produced eit<br>
   her through the rapid combustion of propellants (as with firearms), or by mechanical compre<br>
   ssion (as with air guns). The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile, accele<br>
   rating it down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its <br>
   further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it at the end<br>
   of the tube. Alternatively, acceleration via electromagnetic field generation may be emplo<br>
   yed, in which case the shooting tube may be substituted by guide rails (as in railguns) or<br>
    wrapped with magnetic coils (as in coilguns).
