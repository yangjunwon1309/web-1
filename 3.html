  into the bore walls. The term was originally rifled gun, with the word "rifle" <br>
  referring to the machining process of creating grooving with cutting tools, and<br>
  is now used for any long handheld device designed for aimed discharge activated<br>
  by a trigger, such as air rifles and the personnel halting and stimulation resp<br>
